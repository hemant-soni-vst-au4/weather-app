- Thanks to [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) for the guidance.

## Future features and improvements

- A better UX and design for the page.
- Instead of a sequential async call stack for `index.js`, implement a timeout-based approach as to not overwhelm the Telepor API with requests when typing a city name.
